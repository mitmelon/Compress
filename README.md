 Advanced file compresser which reduces and encrypts large files to smaller chunks by saving them as binary for later use. Many applications supports file uploads which consumes large memory sizes on their systems. This library has been designed to reduce both zip, rar, images, pdf, words sizes or any kinds of files or documents into smaller pieces.

## Install:
Use composer to install
```php
composer require mitmelon/compress
```

## Usage :

```php
require_once __DIR__."/vendor/autoload.php";

// Initialize library class
$compress = new Compress\Compress;

/**
 * @param String $filePath
 * File location to be compressed
 * @param String $storePath
 * Path to output compressed binary file to
 * @param Array optional $options ["removeMeta" => false, "encrypt" => false, "key" => "password"]
 * Options to remove meta and encrypt file
 */
$compress::compressFile($filePath, $storePath, $options = []);

//Compress Image file
$compress::compressFile(__DIR__.'/image.png', __DIR__.'/image.txt'));

// Compress PDF
$compress::compressFile(__DIR__.'/file.pdf', __DIR__.'/file.txt', true));
//Compress as lot of files you want including zip files

/**
 * UnCompress Image file [Get original file back from stored binary]
 * @param String $storePath
 * Path containing binary file which was compressed
 * @param String $fileOutputPath
 * Path to output original file to
 * @param String $encrypt_key
 * If your file was encrypted then provide the key for decryption as third argument
 */
$compress::uncompressFile($storePath, $fileOutputPath, $encrypt_key = null);

//Uncompress Image
$compress::uncompressFile(__DIR__.'/image.txt', __DIR__.'/image.png');

// Uncompress PDF
$compress::uncompressFile( __DIR__.'/file.txt', __DIR__.'/file.pdf')

```
